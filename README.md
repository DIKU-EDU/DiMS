DiMS â€” Didactical MIPS/Machine Simulator
========================================

DiMS is a MIPS/machine simulator designed for educational purposes. It is the
brainchild of the Machine Architecture 2015 course at DIKU, and has two
intended purposes:

  1. A simple MIPS/machine simulator intended for teaching machine architecture
     and baseline systems programming.

  2. A black-box simulator intended for teaching more advanced Computer Science
     concepts, such as, Compilers and Operating Systems.

Ideally, when 2 follows 1, it is feasible for the good students to fully
understand the blackbox they are dealing with.

``dims`` is also a Danish word for a small gizmo, a thing whose name is either
forgotten or unknown, but is useful for a particular job.
