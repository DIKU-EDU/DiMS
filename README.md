DiMS — Didactical MIPS/Machine Simulator
========================================

DiMS is a MIPS/machine simulator designed for educational purposes. It is the
brainchild of the [Machine Architecture
2015](https://github.com/onlineta/ark15) course at [DIKU](http://www.diku.dk/),
and has two intended purposes:

  1. A simple MIPS/machine simulator intended for teaching computer
     architecture and baseline systems programming.

  2. A black-box simulator intended for teaching more advanced Computer Science
     concepts, such as, Compilers and Operating Systems.

Ideally, when 2 follows 1, it is feasible for the good students to fully
grasp (and utilize) the black-box beneath them.

``dims`` is also a Danish word for a small gizmo, a thing whose name is either
forgotten or unknown, but is useful for a particular job.
